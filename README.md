## Hi, I'm Bansari! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate third-year Electrical Engineering student with a minor in Mathematics. I have hands-on experience in R&D, battery validation and testing, and automation using Arduino and Python. I'm currently working in the automotive industry and enjoy its fast-paced, versatile environment, but I'm also eager to explore other areas like automation and robotics. Here are some of my side projects, mostly games, that I've enjoyed making in my free time. ðŸ˜Š
